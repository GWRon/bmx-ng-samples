# bmx-ng-samples
Samples copied from BRL's BlitzMax project and adjusted for BMX-NG.

# Licence
BlitzMax-NG samples are, if not released into Public Domain, released
under the zlib/libpng license.

So the samples just use the same licence the original BlitzMax-project
got released under when BRL released the sources on github.com:
